## Description of the dataset
Despite advancements in data-centric security systems and firewalls, individuals remain vulnerable to the theft of personal and financial information due to the sophisticated strategies employed by cybercriminals. The widespread practice of conducting transactions online presents ample opportunities for attackers to launch phishing campaigns. These phishing attempts are increasingly difficult to identify, blending seamlessly with legitimate communicationsâ€”a challenge even cybersecurity experts acknowledge.

The dataset features 11,430 URLs, each with 87 unique attributes, serving as an effective benchmark for the development and evaluation of machine learning algorithms designed for phishing detection. The attributes are categorized into three groups:
56 attributes are based on the structure and syntax of the URLs,
24 are derived from the content of the associated web pages,
7 are obtained through external service queries. With an equal distribution of phishing and legitimate URLs, the dataset provides a well-balanced foundation for detection system development.

## Methods description
Target Variables: The variable of interest in this study is categorical and serves to distinguish legitimate websites from phishing attempts. The classification task at hand is binary in nature, requiring the use of algorithms that are specifically designed to model categorical outcomes. As such, it is crucial to select appropriate methods that are capable of accurately and efficiently handling this type of data.

Features included: the modeling features chosen comprise a variety of numerical values that depict different aspects of URLs. These features include ratio_digits_url, which indicates the proportion of digits in the URL and can highlight nonsensical or auto generated URLs typically found in phishing; length_words_raw, which denotes the total length of words in the URL and can expose overly long or short URLs that are common in phishing attempts; and avg_words_raw, avg_word_host, and avg_word_path, which provide insight into the complexity and structure of the URL that can vary significantly between legitimate and phishing URLs. The remaining features, ratio_intHyperlinks, links_in_tags, and safe_anchor, likely relate to the content linked or embedded within a webpage, which phishing sites might exploit to deceive users. Lastly, domain_age and domain_registration_length are important factors to consider, as older and well-established domains are less likely to be associated with phishing compared to newly registered ones.

To address the classification task and visualize clustering within the data, we'll employ a multifaceted approach leveraging both traditional neural networks and advanced deep learning models: our initial models will utilize Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as baselines. These models are exceptionally flexible and capable of modeling intricate nonlinear relationships, making them ideal for distinguishing between phishing and legitimate websites based on the features we have identified.We will also explore the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for automatic pattern detection and utilization of local patterns within URL strings. 

By processing URLs as sequences of characters or tokens, we may uncover common phishing patterns that are not easily recognizable through manual feature engineering.Lastly, we will consider Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) to model the sequential nature of URLs. These models can capture dependencies between different segments of a URL that may indicate malicious intent. Prior to engaging in supervised learning, it would be advisable to employ unsupervised techniques such as t-SNE or UMAP in order to create a visual representation of how URLs cluster together based on the selected features. This approach can facilitate the identification of natural groupings and outliers, thereby informing the subsequent modeling strategy. By gaining a comprehensive understanding of the underlying patterns and trends in the data, a more effective and targeted modeling strategy can be developed, leading to more accurate results and insights.

The strategy involves using a combination of MLP/ANN for baseline modeling, with CNN and LSTM to exploit structural and sequential patterns in URLs for phishing detection. Parallelly, clustering visualization will guide feature selection and model tuning. Addressing anticipated challenges will require a balanced approach to model complexity, data representation, and computational efficiency, ensuring models are both accurate and interpretable.

Potential challenges to consider include the risk of overfitting when using complex neural network-based models, particularly with LSTM and CNN models. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to incorporate regularization techniques, dropout, and rigorous validation. Additionally, while the selected features show promise, their efficacy requires validation, and further feature engineering may be necessary to capture subtle patterns of phishing activity. Furthermore, treating URLs as sequences introduces complexity when using LSTM and CNN models, necessitating decisions on tokenization, handling variable-length inputs, and embedding layers for character-level analysis.
