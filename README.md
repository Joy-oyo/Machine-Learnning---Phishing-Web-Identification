Description of the dataset: Despite advancements in data-centric security systems and firewalls, individuals remain vulnerable to the theft of personal and financial information due to the sophisticated strategies employed by cybercriminals. The widespread practice of conducting transactions online presents ample opportunities for attackers to launch phishing campaigns. These phishing attempts are increasingly difficult to identify, blending seamlessly with legitimate communicationsâ€”a challenge even cybersecurity experts acknowledge.

The dataset features 11,430 URLs, each with 87 unique attributes, serving as an effective benchmark for the development and evaluation of machine learning algorithms designed for phishing detection. The attributes are categorized into three groups:

56 attributes are based on the structure and syntax of the URLs,
24 are derived from the content of the associated web pages,
7 are obtained through external service queries. With an equal distribution of phishing and legitimate URLs, the dataset provides a well-balanced foundation for detection system development.
